    "section_1_title": "Why Wake Up Early is the Mother of All Habits",
    "section_1": "Waking up early gives you a head start. It creates space for calm, focused time before the world gets noisy. This habit gives you full control of your day from the start. When you rise early, you’re more likely to plan, think clearly, and follow routines. It builds discipline, and discipline is the root of all other good habits. That’s why waking up early is often called the “mother of all habits.”",

Follow it with <span class=\"highlight-montserrat-bold\">journaling</span> to reflect, set intentions, or clear lingering thoughts. Then, spend some time <span class=\"highlight-montserrat-bold\">reading</span>; mornings are ideal for deep focus. After that, drink a glass of water to <span class=\"highlight-montserrat-bold\">hydrate</span> your body. Finally, plan your day by listing your top three tasks. This simple flow turns your morning into a structured, energizing routine that sets the tone for a productive day.",

    "section_1_title": "How Journaling Prevents Overthinking?",
    "section_1": "Journaling prevents overthinking by letting you dump your thoughts onto paper, breaking the cycle of endless worry. It helps you spot patterns, like repeated fears, and address them logically. Writing organizes your mind, reducing mental clutter and anxiety. Over time, it teaches you to let go of unhelpful thoughts, replacing them with solutions or acceptance, keeping your mind calm and present.",
    "section_2_title": "What is a Journal?",
    "section_2": "A journal is a personal notebook where you write your thoughts, feelings, or daily events. It’s like a private friend that listens without judging. You can use it to track goals, express emotions, or just ramble. Whether on paper or digitally, it’s a safe space to be yourself. It helps you reflect, grow, and understand your life better with every entry.\n\nThere are several journal types to suit your style. Gratitude journaling boosts positivity by noting things you’re thankful for. Art journaling mixes drawings and words for creative expression. Bullet journaling organizes tasks with lists and symbols. Junk journaling uses random items like tickets for a messy, fun vibe. Travel journaling captures adventures with notes and mementos. Each type offers a unique way to connect with yourself.",
    "section_3_title": "Best Time for Journaling?",
    "section_3": "The best time for journaling is morning, when your mind is fresh, setting a positive tone for the day. Evening works too, letting you unwind and reflect on experiences. Choose a quiet moment, like after breakfast or before bed, for 10-15 minutes. Consistency matters more than the exact time, so pick what fits your routine to make it a relaxing habit that sticks.",
