    "section_2_title": "What is a Journal?",
    "section_2": "A journal is a personal notebook where you write your thoughts, feelings, or daily events. It’s like a private friend that listens without judging. You can use it to track goals, express emotions, or just ramble. Whether on paper or digitally, it’s a safe space to be yourself. It helps you reflect, grow, and understand your life better with every entry.\n\nThere are several journal types to suit your style. Gratitude journaling boosts positivity by noting things you’re thankful for. Art journaling mixes drawings and words for creative expression. Bullet journaling organizes tasks with lists and symbols. Junk journaling uses random items like tickets for a messy, fun vibe. Travel journaling captures adventures with notes and mementos. Each type offers a unique way to connect with yourself.",
    "section_3_title": "Best Time for Journaling?",

Choose a quiet moment, like after breakfast or before bed, for 10-15 minutes. Consistency matters more than the exact time, so pick what fits your routine to make it a relaxing habit that sticks.",
